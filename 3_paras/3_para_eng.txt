Haven’t we all heard about so many unfortunate people who, for some
emergency, left their rooms without the pathaka and got arrested in the
market, in public places or in front of mosques. How many days did we
walk through the vegetable market, the fish market and busy streets hoping
to get arrested? Many a muthawwa went past us, not one stopped us. Many
a policeman came across us, none checked us. What’s more, we even
loitered near mosques during prayer times without going in to pray. We
tried it at several mosques and during different parts of the day. Still no one
noticed us. One day, I even deliberately tripped on a policeman’s foot.
Instead of questioning me, he lifted me up, apologized profusely in the
name of Allah and sent me away. Why is it that even misfortune hesitates to
visit us when we need it desperately?

Finally, seeing no other way, we chose to come and stand in front of the
police station; still, no use. After a while, we decided to cross the sentries
and walk into the station. As soon as the suggestion came from Hameed, I
got up and started walking, as if I had been waiting to hear it. I couldn’t
wait any longer. As we went past the long iron crossbar, the sentry who was
reading raised his eyes and called us. We went back to the sentry box and
said we wanted to see the mudeer. Gesturing us to proceed, he went back to
his book.

We stepped into the police station and climbed up a long flight of steps,
walking past doors bearing large inscriptions of verses from the Quran.
Under a notice board in which papers were pinned like decoration, we
spotted some policemen sitting and eating khubus and drinking kahwa,
talking noisily. We stood quietly in front of the counter. On seeing us, one
of them broke away from the conversation and raised his eyebrows while he
continued to eat.
